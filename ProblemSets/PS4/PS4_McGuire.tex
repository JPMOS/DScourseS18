\section{Data Sources}

Twitter, specifically the text from a random sample of all tweets during a given period.

\section{Other Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[6.4] What is the class of each? We get a SparkDataFrame and a data.frame. 
    \item[ 6.(5.b / 6.b)] What happens when you use filter or select in a SparkR session on a traditional dataframe? It says there's no inherited method for a data.frame. R doesn't know what to do because the method is specifically built into the base language of SparkR for SparkDataFrames. SparkR appears to be built on the same root package as dplyr, plyr.
